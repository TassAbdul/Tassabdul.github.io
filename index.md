I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate at Brown University, co-advised by Carsten Eickhoff in the [Health AI](http://brown.edu/Research/AI/people/carsten.html) and Ritambhara Singh in the [Singh Lab](https://ritambharasingh.com/). I am also a [ACM SIGHPC Fellow](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2022-fellowship-winners).

My research focuses on developing reliable and trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. I focus on core challenges, such as improving factuality, robustness, and safety, with a deep interest in ensuring these qualities hold in high-stakes, low-resource, and multilingual environments.

**Current Research Areas:**
*   **Clinical Decision Support:** In collaboration with [Dr. Hamish Fraser](https://bcbi.brown.edu/people/hamish-fraser-mbchb-msc-facmi-fiashi) and [Bio-RAMP Labs](https://bioramp.org/), I assess the safety and clinical applicability of generative AI in low-resource settings.
*   **Global Accessibility:** Through the [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io/) NLP community, I work on evaluating automatic speech recognition and Multimodal systems to improve healthcare accessibility in low- and middle-income countries.

Prior to Brown, I obtained a Master’s in Computer Science from the University of Cape Town, where I worked with Professor [Geoff Nitschke](http://www.nitschke-lab.uct.ac.za/nitschke/people) on evolutionary algorithms for predictive modeling.
