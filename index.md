I am a PhD student at the [AI Lab](http://brown.edu/Research/AI/index.html) at Brown University, advised by Professor [Carsten Eickhoff](http://brown.edu/Research/AI/people/carsten.html) and Professor [Ritambhara Singh](https://ritambharasingh.com/). I am currently interested in applying information retrieval and natural language processing for improving individual and public health.

Prior to my graduate studies at Brown, I obtained a Masterâ€™s degree in computer science from the University of Cape Town, South Africa (UCT). At UCT, I worked with Professor [Geoff Nitschke](http://www.nitschke-lab.uct.ac.za/nitschke/people) on applying evolutionary algorithms to optimize machine learning for predictive analysis.
